**ft_printf is part of the first milestone of the 42 Common Core**

The PDF of the original subject is attached.

The goal is to implement the very popular printf function from the C standard library.

This project learnt me how to manage variable arguments with stdarg.h functions and parsing/writing of format strings (%c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, %%) to the standard output with write().
It also reiterates the importance of properly allocating and freeing data.
